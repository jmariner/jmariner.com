### Here's a little bit about me

* I am a high school honor student currently taking AP Physics C and Multivariable Calculus
* I program and make websites, like this one, for fun
* I love to help people through technology
* I generally keep to myself when I can
* I listen to EDM and DnB music (but i'm okay with just about any music)
